        <p>
          I am an enthusiastic entrepreneur with a business education (undergrad at UNC Kenan-Flagler)
           and market research experience (3 years at <a href="https://system1group.com/" target="_blank">System1 Research</a>).
           During my first full-time job in market research, I directed the development of a customizable app version of the popular game
            Catchphrase and launched “Words For Us”. I soon jumped full-time into entrepreneurship to co-found
             <a href="https://www.fisherguiding.com/" target="_blank">Fisher Guiding</a> in Spring 2017.
             After managing product development for a few years, I decided to learn coding as well to add to my entrepreneurial toolkit.
              A few of my other passions are playing and watching sports, volunteering at <a href="http://bythehand.org/" target="_blank">By The Hand Club For Kids</a>,
               and listening to music during most things I do (here’s what I'm listening to on
               <a href="https://open.spotify.com/user/digdugunderdog?si=4CUJChKvSOC1hW5roFEnaQ" target="_blank">Spotify</a>).
